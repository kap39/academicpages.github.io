Katie is currently a postgraduate student at the University of Bath, studying for her integrated PhD in mathematics with the EPSRC Centre for Doctoral Training in Statistical Applied Mathematics (SAMBa). She graduated from Cardiff University in 2019 with a first class integrated undergraduate masters in Mathematics (MMath), and recently completed the masters year of her training at SAMBa with a distinction in her Statistical Applied Aathematics Masters of Research (MRes). 

Her research lies in theoretical and computational fluid dynamics, focusing on lubrication layer theory. Specifically, she is currently reseraching the formation and evolution of the air lubrication layer that arises from impacting droplets, motivated by the pilot-wave 'bouncing droplet' phenomena. Her supervisors are [Prof. Paul Milewski](https://researchportal.bath.ac.uk/en/persons/paul-milewski/) (50%), [Prof Jonathan Evans](https://people.bath.ac.uk/masjde) (25%) and [Dr. Phil Trinh](https://http://www.ptrinh.com/) (25%).
